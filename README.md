# Projects from DataCamp and Others
This repository contains my solutions to multiple projects I conducted. The repository will be updated.

### Skills
I primarily used my **knowledge in R** to work on multiple projects. One of the major advantages of using R is its infinite possibilities of analyzing endless data sprawling out around the world.

A famouse quote from the famous dplyr and ggplot2 inventor Hadley Wickham:
>"The bad news is that when ever you learn a new skill your going to suck. It's going to be frustrating. The good news is that is typical and happens to everyone and it is only temporary. You can't go from knowing nothing to becoming an expert without going through a period of great frustration and great suckiness."
