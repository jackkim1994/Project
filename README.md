# Projects from DataCamp and Others
This repository contains my solutions to multiple projects I conducted. The repository will be updated.

### Skills
I focus on continuously improving my skills in **R, Python** to work on multiple projects. One of the major advantages of using R and python is their infinite possibilities of analyzing endless data sprawling out around the world.

As of now, I'm more comfortable using R as my main data analysis. However, as I learn about python through DataCamp, I realize that python definitely has easier learning curve than R.

A quote from the famous dplyr and ggplot2 inventor Hadley Wickham:
>"The bad news is that whenever you learn a new skill you're going to suck. It's going to be frustrating. The good news is that is typical and happens to everyone and it is only temporary. You can't go from knowing nothing to becoming an expert without going through a period of great frustration and great suckiness."
